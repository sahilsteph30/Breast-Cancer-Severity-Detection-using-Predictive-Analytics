# Breast-cancer-severity-detection-using-predictive-analytics
The primary goal of this project was to build a predictive model using an extensive breast cancer dataset to help medical professionals make more accurate diagnoses and in turn improve patient care. We are excited to share the details of our approach and the outcomes we achieved. To ensure a strong foundation for our predictive models, we preprocessed the data by transforming the target variable, which represented the cancer diagnosis as either malignant or benign. We also scaled the numeric variables, which allowed the models to perform better. The report compares the predictive performance of various machine learning algorithms for breast cancer diagnosis. The results indicate that the random forest algorithm outperforms other models with an accuracy of 0.98, which is higher than KNN, Naive Bayes, and Classification Tree.
